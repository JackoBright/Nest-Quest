Team Policies:
In the event of a disagreement, both members with attempt to resolve the issue by talking, however if this is not possible, we will seek the advise of TAs 

To promote creativity, we will encourage new ideas and be open to other’s ideas. 

In the event that one person doesn’t know what they're supposed to do, we will refer to the responsibilities document and if still confused, message the other person. 

In the event one member doesn’t hear back from the other member, we will try alternative communication strategies and resort to the weekly meeting to bring up questions.

In the event of extenuating circumstances, communicate as early as possible to the other member.

In the event one partner fails to carry their share of the workload on one assignment, it’s their responsibility to take the lead for the next assignment.


Communication Policies:
We will communicate primarily through discord but have also shared email and phone numbers. We are expected to respond within 48 hours.
